 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time:</h2>
 <h3>1.Rockstar</h3>
 <p>It shows the journey of a boy who wanted to be a Rockstar, shows his struggles, how he go with the flow and believe in almighty to get to that position of Rockstar. When he reaches that position, it seems futile to him as his lover is not by his side.
  <h3>2.ZNMD</h3>
 <p>Three friends decide to go to Spain for bachelor party. The movie is filled with great visuals, Spain is indeed a beautiful place, soothing music, great storyline, full of sarcasm and jokes that will definitely make you fall from your chair. The direction is so appealing that  we can feel the emotions to the bone.Must watch if you are looking for travel related theme.</p>  
 <h3>3.Only you</h3>
 <p>This one is Hollywood, one of the classic American 90's Love Story starring one of my favoutite actor Robert Downey Jr. aka RDJ. The movie revolves around a woman who wants to find her lover, travels places in search of him and along the way encountering hicups, still quite persistent in search of the man. The movie will leave you in awe of the romanticism created.
